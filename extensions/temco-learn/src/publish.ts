// Publishing the site: one commit, one push.
//
// The site is its own repository (`temcocontrols/temco-learn`), and the branch is the one the two of us work on. What
// gets published is the *source*: content, the catalog it generates, and the code that renders it. GitHub Actions builds
// the site from that commit and hands the result to Pages, so publishing is a commit and a push and the build stays
// where it already is - in CI, with its own log.
//
// Never a forced push. If the branch carries work this clone does not know about, that is a fact to report - the commit
// is local either way, and the next publish is a fast-forward after a pull.
