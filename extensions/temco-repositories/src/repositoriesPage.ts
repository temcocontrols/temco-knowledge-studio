// held in the catalog, so a refused read costs a warning rather than an empty page.
//
// The Library's *Sources* row lists what has already been read. This is the step before it: what an enterprise has,
// which of them the project being worked on already cites, and the buttons that **start** a repository (add it as
// a source of that project and read its registry) or fetch a local copy of it.
//
// Nothing here writes to a repository. A source is a row in the catalog on this machine, and reading one is
// `read.ts`'s job — the same command the Library uses, so the output and the notes are the same too.
