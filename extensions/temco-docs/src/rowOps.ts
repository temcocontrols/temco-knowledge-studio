// Where a row is, and how to look at it.
//
// Nothing here writes anything. Opening a page belongs to the editor, revealing belongs to the operating
// system's file manager, and the terminal and the clipboard are the two ways a person carries a page's address
// out of the tree. They live together because they are what a row's menu offers *besides* the writes in
// `src/pageOps.ts` — and because they follow the same rule about which row an act is about: the row the command
// was handed, else the row the person has selected in the Workspace view, because the view's toolbar and the
// palette can start an act without naming a row.
//
// **A row's place is derived from the platform's own path rule**, not from where a page happens to be: a page id
// *is* its path under `docs/` (`05-content-and-registry.md` rule 1), so `docs/<area>/<folder>…/` is the folder —
// and a folder can sit inside a folder, so a row carries its whole path rather than one name. Nothing here reads
// the disk to find out, so the answer is the same whether or not the folder has been created yet.
