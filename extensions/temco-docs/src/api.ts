// What this module offers the rest of the platform.
//
// The documentation module publishes its model rather than letting another module read its folders: the sets it
// is reading, the pages of a set, the page a file belongs to, the editor column its surfaces open in, and the
// selection — the one piece of state the whole application agrees on. The AI module is the caller today, and it
// declares this extension as a dependency so that these exports exist before its own `activate()` runs.
//
// The shapes are spelled twice, once here and once in the caller: an extension cannot import another
// extension's sources. This file is the definition; the caller's `src/docs.ts` is the copy, and a change here is
// a change there.
