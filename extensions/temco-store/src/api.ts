// What the store offers the rest of the platform.
//
// The store is the platform's own memory: one SQLite file it writes and reads for itself — which sources were
// read, what a project is made of, which pages came out of a read, what was built, and what happened. It is
// deliberately *not* `temco-sql`: that module is about the databases a **product** uses (registers, queries,
// export), and neither owns nor knows about this file.
//
// One window, one database, one selection — which is why this module opens the file itself rather than letting
// each caller open it with its own extension's storage. A caller that passed its own context would find an empty
// database beside its own code, and two `Selection` instances would not hear each other.
//
// The names are the store's too: a slug is what the tables are keyed by, so the rule that produces one belongs
// with the schema that assumes it.
