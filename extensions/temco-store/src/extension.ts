// The store module's entry point.
//
// It is the platform's own memory, and it has no surface of its own beyond one command: every other module
// writes and reads through the API below, and no module is answered by a second database beside its own code.
//
// Nothing is opened at activation. The database is opened per use and closed by the caller — a window that never
// reads a source never holds a database — and the selection is the one thing kept for the window's lifetime,
// because it is one piece of state with one signal, not a value to be re-made per caller.
