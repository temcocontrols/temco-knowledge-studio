// The AI module's entry point.
//
// It is the sixth module of Temco Platform and it is *not* part of the documentation module: a local model is a
// thing the application runs, and the documentation is one of the things it can be pointed at. That is why this
// is an extension of its own — it has its own container, its own page, its own settings and its own command
// namespace, and it can be left out of an install without the documentation module noticing.
//
// Two directions, and only one of them is a dependency:
//
//   * this module requires `temcocontrols.temco-docs`, whose exports are the documentation model — the sets, the
//     pages, the selection. The panel reads them through `docs.ts` rather than owning a copy.
//   * the documentation module requires nothing of this one. It calls the commands below when the module is
//     installed — a new page's body is drafted, a source is analysed for what it is missing, the AI page opens —
//     and every one of those is a plain command, so an install without this module is a smaller install, not a
//     broken one.
