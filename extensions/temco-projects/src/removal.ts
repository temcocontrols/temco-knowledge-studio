// Removing a project also removes what it left on this machine.
//
// A project is a row in the catalog, and the row is all the rest of the platform reads — which is why removing it
// used to be the whole act. But the project also owns a folder in the working area (`~/Temco/<slug>` by default):
// the clones it fetched and what we made from them. Leaving that behind means the Library forgets a project while
// the disk keeps it, and the next project with the same name inherits a stranger's clones.
//
// The folder is owned by `temco-repositories`, which owns the working area; this module only knows which project the
// application follows. So the two halves are asked for by command — what the folder is, then delete it — and the
// confirmation names the folder before anything happens, because that is the part a person cannot undo.
