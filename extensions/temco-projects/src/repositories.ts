// What this module reads of the repositories module.
//
// Two things, and one idea behind both: a source's **files**. A listing, so a project starting from a repository can
// offer what that repository already documents and what code a page could be written from; and the text of the files
// a person ticked, within one budget, so a draft is grounded in what they chose rather than in a whole repository.
//
// Why the shape is written out: an extension cannot import another extension's sources. The definition is
// `extensions/temco-repositories/src/repository.ts` and `extensions/temco-repositories/src/extension.ts`.
// Repositories is a declared dependency, so it is activated before this module's entry runs.
