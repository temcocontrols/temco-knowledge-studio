// The projects module's entry point.
//
// A project is a documentation project: a name, a version, an audience, an owner, the sources it is made of, the
// outputs it produces, and what building it left behind. This module owns all of that — the list, the edit page,
// the hub, and the build that produces an output.
//
// Two things are deliberately *not* here:
//
//   * what a page of documentation is. The registry, its checks and the pages themselves belong to `temco-docs`;
//     this module reads the pages a project *has* from the platform's memory, where a read recorded them.
//   * the sources themselves. Reading one, cloning one and running one's own scripts belong to
//     `temco-repositories`; this module names a source in a project and records what its build produced.
//
// Nothing is written to a repository. A build is invoked in the source's own folder and judged by the files it
// left behind, never by an exit code, and the deploying form of the help build is never invoked.
