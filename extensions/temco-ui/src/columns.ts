// Where a page of ours opens, decided in one place.
//
// The rule, settled with the user on 2026-10-14 after two wrong answers:
//
//   **our pages are tabs in one group.** The dashboard, a project, the AI page, the repositories page and the
//   documentation pages they open all share a single tab strip, so whichever one you are on fills the whole
//   editor area. Never a split: a page in half the window is not "shown", and two groups means one of them is
//   always too narrow.
//
// The first attempt asked "is the tab in front one of ours?" and fell back to `Beside` when the answer was no —
// which is what produced the split, because a webview tab does not report its view type the way that check
// assumed. The second attempt asked the *same* question and had the same flaw. So this asks nothing about what
// is in front: it looks for the group that already holds a page of ours and opens there. Our pages can only
// ever occupy one group, whatever is clicked, from wherever.
//
// It moved here from the documentation module when the pages stopped living in one module: a rule that every
// module's page depends on cannot be owned by whichever module happened to open the first one.
