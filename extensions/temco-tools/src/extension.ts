// Temco Tools — the device and data surfaces, one container each until their own modules exist.
//
// Five studios, each with its own pages:
//
//   * **Devices** — six pages;
//   * **I/O Studio** — five pages;
//   * **BACnet Studio** — five pages;
//   * **Network** — four pages;
//   * **SQL Studio** — Workbench and Docs Database, six pages, and the only one that still keeps a side bar of its
//     own: those two views are declared under `temcoSql` and are the only `createTreeView` calls left here.
//
// Every one of them was a folded section of a single page until the mock's side bar was taken seriously: each row has
// its own title, its own count where the count means something, and its own actions, and a folded section cannot carry
// any of those. Each studio owns its pages (`devices.ts`, `io.ts`, `bacnet.ts`, `network.ts`, `sqlStudio.ts`) and its
// sample; this file is only the wiring — the activation and the views.
//
// **What is real and what is sample.** The pages, their navigation, their vocabulary and their buttons are real: a
// button asks, changes the studio's register, re-renders and reports what it changed. The rows are the mock's sample
// for the four device studios, because those have no socket to a controller, no BACnet stack and no capture device
// yet. **SQL Studio is not a sample**: it runs statements against the platform's own database, reads its schema back
// and can clear or reset it — see `sqlStudio.ts`.
