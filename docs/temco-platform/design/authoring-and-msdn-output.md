# Authoring parity with Dr.Explain, publishing parity with MSDN

The product direction is two references at once, and they answer different questions:

- **Dr.Explain** is the *authoring* reference: how a person starts a project, brings existing material in, and edits topics with their properties in front of them.
- **MSDN** is the *output* reference: what a reader gets. The website is the product; CHM and PDF are the same tree in other clothes.

Where the two disagree, MSDN wins — a surface that looks like Dr.Explain but does not produce an MSDN-shaped site has failed the requirement.

## 1. Where we stand today

Everything below is what the code does, not what the mock draws.

| Thing | Where | Reality today |
|---|---|---|
| A project | catalog `documents` row (`extensions/temco-store/src/catalog/schema.ts`) | name, slug, version, audience, owner, timestamps |
| What it reads | `doc_sources` (many-to-many, per-source branch + include glob) | created by the wizard's **Sources** step |
| What it builds | `recipes` (`engine`, `config_path`, `script`, `outputs`) | the wizard writes `engine: 'docfx'` and the ticked outputs |
| Outputs offered | `extensions/temco-projects/src/projectFlow.ts` | website · PDF · offline help (CHM) · search index · AI index |
| Creation flow | `src/projectFlow.ts` | 4 steps: **Basics** (name, version, owner, audience) → **Sources** → **Outputs** → **Review** |
| Content | each product repository's `docs/help/registry.json` + Markdown (`extensions/temco-docs/src/registry.ts`) | the repository is the source of truth; the platform reads it |
| Page metadata already modelled | `RegistryPage` | `title, area, chapter, order, audience, ship, owner, tags, keywords, help_ids, code, reviewed` |
| Authoring already implemented | `newPagePage.ts` (3-step new page), `pageOps.ts` (`writePage` — the only disk write), `registryEdit.ts` (field writes) | a page is created from the location + template + draft, and registry fields survive regeneration |
| Builds | `extensions/temco-docs/src/builds.ts` | the **repository's own scripts** (`docs:site`, `docs:build`, `build:help:dry`) run as VS Code tasks, and success is judged by the artifacts |
| Checks | `diagnostics.ts`, `sections.ts` | structure, staleness, unreviewed pages |

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

1. **We already have the Dr.Explain page properties.** `ship` is its "export conditions", `help_ids` is its "help context ID", `keywords` is its index, `order` is its TOC position, and `owner`/`audience`/`reviewed` are its bookkeeping. Nothing in the data model is missing for authoring.
2. **We are missing the front door and the import.** Creation starts at "name, version, owner" — a project is assumed to have content already. There is no way to begin from a Word file, an HTML folder, a CHM, a template, or a repository.

## 2. Dr.Explain's flow, from the surfaces

Start page:

- four ways in — **Create a local project**, **Create a shared project on the server**, **Checkout project from the server**, **Open an existing project**;
- six importers — **Microsoft Word**, **RTF**, **Compiled HTML Help (CHM)**, **HLP**, **Standalone HTML**, **folder of HTML/TXT/XML**;
- **recent projects** and **templates in all languages**.

Editor:

- topic tree with a synthetic *Title* / *Table of contents* root and numbered topics;
- **properties panel** per topic: title, filename, export conditions, status, header/footer, page numbering, help context IDs;
- central page with **Menu / Index / Search** tabs;
- toolbar previews: **Content editor**, **HTML preview**, **CHM preview**, **PDF preview**;
- AI assistant rail with the model/provider setting.

## 3. Gap analysis

| Capability | Dr.Explain | Us today | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start from nothing | local project | **have it** (Basics step) | — |
| Start from a template | templates in all languages | no | a template is a repository-shaped skeleton; cheap and high value |
| Start from existing material | Word, RTF, CHM, HLP, HTML, folder | no | **the biggest gap** |
| Shared / checkout | server + checkout | git remote + clone exists in `temco-repositories`, not in the project flow | map to git, do not build a server |
| Topic tree editing | drag, renumber, nest | tree view + `order` field | add reorder → `order` write |
| Per-topic properties | full panel | registry fields, but no form | **form over `registryEdit`** |
| Export conditions | per topic | `ship` | expose it |
| Context IDs / index | per topic | `help_ids`, `keywords` | expose them |
| WYSIWYG body editing | HTML editor inside the tool | Markdown in the editor + rendered preview | do **not** copy; MSDN topics are Markdown |
| Preview before build | HTML · CHM · PDF | HTML preview exists; CHM/PDF only after a build | add CHM/PDF preview after first build |
| MSDN-shaped site | — | the site is the repository generator's; our output choice is `website` | make the contract explicit (§5) |

## 4. Decisions

**D1 — Creation asks *where the content comes from*, not a cosmetic "type".**
The origin decides which steps follow and what gets written on *Create*. A dropdown that changes nothing is worse than none.

| Origin | What it does on Create | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| **Blank project** | creates the project; the first page is authored here | `documents` + `recipes` |
| **From template** | copies a template folder into the chosen location, then the project cites it | template tree + `documents` + `doc_sources` |
| **From a repository** (Dr.Explain's "shared") | clones/attaches a remote at a branch and reads its `docs/help/registry.json` | `sources` + `doc_sources` |
| **Import a document set** | converts the material into pages, then the project cites the folder | Markdown tree + registry entries + `doc_sources` |
| **Open existing** | picks a folder that already holds a registry | `sources` only |

**D2 — Importers write the repository's contract, never a second content store.**
An importer is a converter: source → `docs/help/*.md` + `docs/help/registry.json`, exactly the shape the product's own generator writes. The platform database stays what it is (a register of projects, sources, builds, releases) — otherwise the same text would live twice and drift.

**D3 — MSDN is an output contract, not a theme.** See §5.

**D4 — Page properties are ours already; add only what MSDN needs.**
Expose `ship`, `order`, `keywords`, `help_ids`, `audience`, `owner` through a form in the page editor. Two new optional fields are worth having: `kind` (concept · how-to · reference · tutorial — MSDN's `ms.topic`) and `applies_to` (the product versions a page is for). Header/footer and page numbering are **template** settings for PDF, not per page.

**D5 — Collaboration is git, not a server.** "Shared project" = a project whose source is a repository with a remote; "checkout" = clone + branch; review is a pull request. `temco-repositories` already clones, pulls and records branches. Building a Dr.Explain server would duplicate what the repository host already does better.

**D6 — The website is the product; CHM and PDF derive from it.**
One tree, three targets: website (primary), CHM (same topics, `help_ids` → HH context IDs, `keywords` → index), PDF (one print profile).

## 5. The MSDN contract (what "similar to MSDN" means concretely)

**Structure.** `area → chapter → topic`, the shape the registry already has. A topic is one Markdown file; `order` decides TOC position; a page not in the registry is not published.

**URL.** `/{area}/{chapter}/{slug}` — stable, lowercase, no build hash. Renaming a slug writes a redirect entry, because links outlive builds.

**Every topic page carries:**

- breadcrumb `Area / Chapter / Title`;
- left **TOC** of the whole set with the current branch open;
- an **on-page TOC** built from `##`/`###`;
- **Applies to** (from `applies_to`, or the project version);
- **previous / next** in TOC order;
- **feedback** and a "this page is stale" signal from `reviewed`;
- a permalink for every heading.

**Index and search.** `keywords` feeds the site index; the search index (already a wizard target) is built from titles, headings and keywords, so a reader can reach a page by a controller's name as well as by its title.

**Version selector.** A released version is a `releases` row; the site serves the newest plus archived versions. The version selector is a list of those rows, not a rebuild.

**CHM.** The same tree compiled with `help_ids` as context IDs, `keywords` as the index, and the chapters as the TOC levels. A topic that is `ship: false` is in the site's draft preview and not in the CHM.

**Where the furniture is produced — and why Temco Learn is not it.** A topic page is rendered by the product repository's own site generator (`docs:site`), and Learn's *Article Preview* opens the published file rather than drawing a second copy of it (`extensions/temco-workbench/src/learnPages.ts`: *“a preview that can disagree with the shipped page is worse than no preview”*). So the platform's half of the contract is **the metadata that makes the furniture possible** — `order` for the TOC, `keywords` for the index, `ship` for what is published, `help_ids` for the CHM, `title` for the heading and the breadcrumb — and the generator's half is drawing it. Adding a page-properties form (phase 2, below) is what closes the loop between them.

## 6. The project flow, redesigned

Five steps; step 2–4 are the steps we have, unchanged in content.

1. **Origin** — Blank · Template · Repository · Import · Open existing.
2. **Basics** — name, version, owner, audience (today's step 1).
3. **Bring in** — *shape follows the origin*: template picker · repository picker (remote + branch) · importer picker (Word/RTF/HTML/HTML folder/CHM) with a destination folder · folder picker.
4. **What it builds** — the targets we already offer, with **Website** ticked for a new project.
5. **Review** — what will be written, and where the files land. Nothing is written before this step.

Two rules stay: nothing is written until the last button, and the project you create becomes the selected project.

## 7. Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | `documents.origin` + `documents.template` (schema 4, with a migration); wizard step **Origin** (blank · repository · folder · template · import), where the origin decides what the third step asks; a template writes a starter `docs/help` tree and refuses to overwrite anything; folder and template projects record their folder as a source | **done** |
| **2** | Page-properties form (`temcoDocs.pageProperties`, Markdown title-bar action) over `registryEdit`: title, owner, audience, order, ships, keywords, tags, `help_ids`, with the confirmation naming every value it will write | **done** |
| **3** | Importers (`temcoDocs.import`, called by the wizard's *Import a document set* origin): **HTML folder / page** and **Markdown folder** natively; **Word / RTF / ODT** through pandoc; **CHM** through `hh.exe -decompile` (Windows). All four write the repository contract and refuse a folder that already has a registry | **done** |
| **4** | The platform's half of the MSDN contract: the metadata itself (`title`, `order`, `keywords`, `ship`, `help_ids`, `audience`), which phase 2 made editable and which the module's existing validation already reports on. A separate readiness page was built and then removed: it re-tested the same fields without adding a decision, and the Pipeline group already has Review Center and Build Center. The drawing half — breadcrumb, on-page TOC, prev/next, permalinks, redirects, version selector — belongs to each product repository's `docs:site` generator, which is not in this repository | **platform half done** |
| **5** | CHM/PDF previews after a build (`temcoDocs.openArtifact`, from the Build Center's artifact rows); drag reorder → `order` (already in `pageOps.handleDrop`); the repository origin cites recorded sources and links to the Sources page, where `temcoRepositories.fetchSource` clones | **done** |

**Phase 1 is the answer to "do we add more types?"** — yes, five origins, and each one changes what the next step asks.

## 8. What we deliberately do not copy

- **Its WYSIWYG HTML editor.** MSDN topics are Markdown; the editor is VS Code's, and the page renders beside it.
- **Its project database.** The repository keeps the text; the platform keeps the register.
- **Its server and checkout.** Git and pull requests.
- **Its single-file exports as the main path.** The site is the product; CHM is one of its outputs.
