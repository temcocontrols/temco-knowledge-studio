# `temco-ai`

The local-AI module: it runs a model on this machine and answers from the documentation it is given.

| | |
|---|---|
| Folder | `extensions/temco-ai` |
| Extension id | `temcocontrols.temco-ai` |
| Namespace | `temcoAi` |
| State | active |
| Container | **Temco AI** (`temcoAi`) in the right side bar — the panel (`temcoAi.panel`) |
| Requires | `temcocontrols.temco-docs` |
| Settings | `temcoAi.modelFolder`, `temcoAi.allowUnpinned`, `temcoAi.runtime`, `temcoAi.model`, `temcoAi.idleMinutes` |

## Responsibilities, one file each

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/extension.ts` | activation, the panel, and the model the rest of the platform reads (`status`, `facts`, `modelLabel`, `analyse`, `draft`) |
| `src/docs.ts` | what this module reads of `temco-docs` — the contract in one file, and the only place that crosses modules |
| `src/surface.ts` | the AI page's view type |
| `src/aiPage.ts` | the page: the runtime, the model, the folder they live in, the downloads, and the log |
| `src/ai/catalog.ts` | what can be downloaded: the pinned llama.cpp build with the checksums GitHub publishes, the models on offer, their licences. No network, no filesystem |
| `src/ai/install.ts` | the model folder, the resumable download and its checksum check, the unpack, and the manifest of what is installed |
| `src/ai/runtime.ts` | the local server process: started on demand on a loopback port, health-checked, stopped when idle — and the single `complete()` call everything else uses |
| `src/ai/machine.ts` | what this machine can run, and which catalog entry suits it |
| `src/ai/history.ts` | the commits a draft is about: `git log` over the page's `code` globs since its last review, metadata and paths only. Never throws |
| `src/ai/prompts.ts` | loads `prompts/*.md` and fills them in: the house rules, the question, the draft, the area, a new page. The only text that may reach the model |
| `src/ai/citations.ts` | what an answer pointed at: the ids that resolve, the ids that do not, and the plain term search behind a low-confidence fallback |
| `src/ai/panel.ts` | the panel: chat about the open page, `Draft update` as a diff, `Ask the area`, and the model line. Decides nothing itself |
| `src/ai/commands.ts` | the list a person picks from: install, use, remove, open the folder, and the AI's status |
| `media/` | the panel's script and styles (`ai-panel.js` is a browser asset, not extension code) and the module's icon |
| `prompts/` | the templates the module sends to the model, one file per task |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `temcoAi.page` | opens the AI page, or one of its sections (`downloads`) |
| `temcoAi.openPanel` | focuses the panel in the right side bar |
| `temcoAi.models` | the list of runtimes and models: what is installed, what can be downloaded, which one is in use |
| `temcoAi.removeModel` | deletes an installed runtime or model, and clears it from the settings when it was the one in use |
| `temcoAi.openModelFolder` | opens the folder the downloads live in |
| `temcoAi.dockRight` | shows the AI in the right side bar |
| `temcoAi.status` | which runtime and model are in use, whether the server is running, and how to stop it or read its log |

## How it reads the documentation

One declared dependency, in one direction:

- this module **requires** `temcocontrols.temco-docs`, so that module is activated first and its exports — the
  sets, `collectPages`, `pageForUri`, the selection, the editor column, one change signal — are ready when this
  module's `activate()` runs. `src/docs.ts` is where they are declared and where a call reaches them.
- the documentation module **requires nothing** of this one. It calls `temcoAi.page` and `temcoAi.models` for what
  a person opens, and asks this module's exports for the two things that are work rather than navigation: a body
  to draft, and a source to analyse. It gates the rows and menu entries it shows on `temcoDocs.aiInstalled`, so an
  install without this module shows no door that does not open.

## What it never does

- Writes a page. A draft goes back to the page that asked for it, and a person accepts it as one undoable edit.
- Leaves the machine. The runtime listens on loopback, models arrive only from a command a person ran, and the
  only thing that ever leaves is an API read the documentation module asked for.
- Ships native code. A compiled engine is per-OS, so it is downloaded on request into the user's own folder.
