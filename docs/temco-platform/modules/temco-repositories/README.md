# `temco-repositories`

The organisation and the local copies of it: the repository list, the working area, and reading a source into the platform's memory.

| | |
|---|---|
| Folder | `extensions/temco-repositories` |
| Extension id | `temcocontrols.temco-repositories` |
| Namespace | `temcoRepositories` |
| State | active |
| Page | **The Repositories** (`temcoRepositories.page`) — a webview tab, opened by its own command |
| Settings | `temcoRepositories.organisation`, `temcoRepositories.workspaceFolder` |
| Requires | `temco-store` (the platform's memory), `temco-ui` (where a page opens) |
| Required by | `temco-docs` — for the code files of a source and the material a new page is drafted from |

## Responsibilities, one file each

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/extension.ts` | activation, the page command, the output channel, the change signal, and the API |
| `src/repository.ts` | the organisation's repositories as an API read (paged, with a token when there is one), and a source's code files — from a working tree or from `git/trees` |
| `src/read.ts` | reading a source: the registry it declares, parsed for pages, recorded in the catalog with what the read concluded; the token in secret storage; opening a file over the API |
| `src/workarea.ts` | the working area: where a clone goes, whether one is there, how big it is, and clone / pull / remove |
| `src/repositoriesPage.ts` | the page: what the organisation has, what has been read, what has a local copy, and the buttons for each |
| `src/surface.ts` | the page's view type (`temcoRepositories.page`) |
| `src/store.ts` · `src/ui.ts` | what this module reads of `temco-store` and `temco-ui` — the copies of their shapes |

## Commands

`temcoRepositories.page` · `readSource` · `readAllSources` · `removeSource` · `revealSource` · `setSourceBranch` · `openFile` · `setToken` · `fetchSource` · `pullSource` · `openClone` · `removeClone` · `changeWorkspaceFolder` · `openWorkFolder` — the working area and reading, each with its own command rather than a mode.

Two of those are for other modules rather than for the palette, and are deliberately not declared: `projectWorkFolder` answers where a project's folder is and whether it exists, and `deleteProjectFolder` deletes it. `temco-projects` asks both when a project is removed, so the confirmation can name the folder before it goes — the working area is this module's, and the project row is that one's.

## Boundary rules

- **Nothing is written to a repository, and nothing is ever pushed.** Every write this module makes is to the catalog; git is used for `clone` and `pull --ff-only` and for reading history, and never for a change to a tracked file.
- **The working area is outside every repository** (`temcoRepositories.workspaceFolder`, default `~/Temco`), so a clone can never be mistaken for a source.
- **A token lives in secret storage**, keyed `temcoRepositories.githubToken`. It is never written to a setting, a file or the catalog.
- **Reading is explicit.** No read, clone or pull happens on its own: the first read offers a local copy, and every act after that is a command a person ran.
- **What a registry means is not decided here.** This module reads the file and records the rows; the registry's shape, its checks and its areas are `temco-docs`', which is why this module needs nothing from it.
- **The page opens where our pages open.** That rule is `temco-ui`'s — one group, never a split — and it is read here rather than re-decided (`src/ui.ts`).
