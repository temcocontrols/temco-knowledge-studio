# The catalog

The platform's memory: one SQLite file, owned by `temco-store`, at
`<globalStorageUri>/catalog/catalog.db` (with its WAL beside it). Every module reads it through
`Catalog.open(context)`; no module opens its own database.

A row is written by an act — a read, a create, a build — and read by a surface. Nothing in the file is derived from
the network at read time: a list from GitHub, for example, is a record of what GitHub *said*, with the time it said
it.

## Shape (schema version 6)

| Table | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `meta` | `schema_version`, and nothing else. |
| `organisations` | Where repositories come from: `kind` (`organisation` \| `account` \| `repository`), `name`, unique `slug`, `url`, `added_at`, `last_read`, `state` (`read` \| `refused` \| `named`). |
| `repositories` | The rows of each list, `org_id` → `organisations(id)` **on delete cascade**, keyed by `(org_id, name)`. A cache of what GitHub last answered — replaced whole per organisation, kept when a read is refused. Indexed by `(org_id, pushed_at DESC)`. |
| `sources` | Where content actually comes from: a git remote at a branch, a folder, or an archive. Unique `slug`; `last_read`, `last_read_mode`, `last_commit`. **The truth about a repository is a source, not a cached row.** |
| `documents` | The projects a person manages — `name`, unique `slug`, `version`, `audience`, `owner`, `origin`, `template`, timestamps. |
| `doc_sources` | Many-to-many: a document cites sources, each with its own `branch`, `include_glob`, `role`. |
| `recipes` | One row per document: the engine (`docfx`), its `config_path`, `script`, and the `outputs` it must produce. |
| `builds`, `artifacts` | A build attempt and what it left behind, by document. |
| `commits`, `commit_pages` | What a read found in a source's history, and which pages a commit touched. |
| `pages` | The pages a read recorded, by source and page id. |
| `scans` | One row per read: mode, revision, counts. |
| `events` | What the platform noticed and has not shown (`seen_at` null). |
| `drafts` | A page's text with no file behind it: `document_slug`, `page_id` (the id it *will* have), `title`, `kind`, `body`, `state` (`draft` \| `accepted` \| `discarded`). |
| `releases` | Published versions, by document. |

## Versioning

`SCHEMA` is applied with `IF NOT EXISTS` on every open, then `meta.schema_version` decides whether migrations run.
A version from the future is **refused in words** rather than half-read. `MIGRATIONS[n]` is what a version `n-1`
file needs to become `n`:

- 4 — `documents.origin`, `documents.template`
- 6 — drops `repo_lists`, the one-turn JSON blob that `organisations` + `repositories` replaced

## Where the settings sit

Two settings decide what the repositories surfaces act on, and both are written by
`temcoRepositories.settings` (the page) or by VS Code's own settings JSON:

- `temcoRepositories.organisation` — the enterprise the dashboard opens on, and the one seeded into
  `organisations` the first time the page opens.
- `temcoRepositories.workspaceFolder` — where local copies are downloaded and drafts are written. Empty means
  `~/Temco`. It is outside every repository on purpose: nothing is ever written to a source, and nothing is pushed.
