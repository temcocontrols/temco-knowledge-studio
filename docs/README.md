# Temco Platform — documentation

Two products, two folders.

| Folder | What it documents |
|---|---|
| [`temco-platform/`](temco-platform/README.md) | **Temco Platform** — the application: the shell, its modules, how it is built, and the rules that keep it that way |
| [`temco-learn/`](temco-learn/README.md) | **Temco Learn** — the published documentation site: the content model, the engine, the template, search, the offline artifacts, and the review flow |

Read [`temco-platform/README.md`](temco-platform/README.md) when you are writing code.
Read [`temco-learn/README.md`](temco-learn/README.md) when you are producing documentation for a product.

   ├─ README.md            the site: what it serves and how it is produced

## The rules these documents follow

- A document describes **what is true now and what will be built** — never how the decision was reached, when, or by whom.
- **No dates, no progress marks, no meeting notes.** If something is not part of the product, it is not here.
- One subject per document, and the document's name is the name of the subject.
- The design documents of `temco-learn/design/` carry a number so they can be read in order; everything else does not need one.
